# Derafu: Enum - Yet Another List of Enumerations for PHP

A PHP repository for global enumerations.

## Note on Enumerations

While this package provides a basic set of enumerations for specific use cases, it is highly recommended to consider using [PrinsFrank/standards](https://github.com/PrinsFrank/standards) for more comprehensive enumeration needs. The PrinsFrank/standards package offers:

- A more extensive collection of standardized enumerations.
- Regular updates based on international standards.
- Better maintained and widely adopted in the PHP community.
- More robust validation and type-safety features.

This package (derafu/enum) should be considered primarily for very specific use cases where the more comprehensive solution might be unnecessary or when you need custom enumerations not covered by standard libraries.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require derafu/enum
```
